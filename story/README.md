JSON SERVER
===========

First step you install the json server using the following command:
npm install -g jso  n-server

Then, you can run the command and select the port using the following command:
npx json-server --watch -p 3333 server.json

Change 3333 to the port number you want and replace server.json with the name of your fake api.
